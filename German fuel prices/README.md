The dataset is inspiration from the blog (https://www.r-bloggers.com/2017/07/the-german-fuel-prices-data-set/)

The dataset is not available in the repo due to size restrictions

Dataset has prices for fuel (Gasoline, E5, E10) for various gas stations of different brands in different locations across Germany between June 2014 till October 2015.
The work on datset is focused on Data cleaning and EDA.
